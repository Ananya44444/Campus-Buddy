## 📌 Problem

Students often miss campus events due to scattered communication. There's no smart, filtered system to discover or RSVP to events happening across college.

## 🚀 Solution

Campus Buddy is a smart platform for students to:
- View and RSVP to upcoming and past events
- Discover events by tags, department, or club
- Let clubs manage and post events via their login
- Filter events based on interests and types
