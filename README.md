# 🎓 Campus Buddy

A centralized platform for **students and clubs at NST** to discover, manage, and track campus events — helping the campus stay connected and engaged.

---

## 📌 Problem

At NST-ADYPU, students often miss out on exciting campus events — workshops, fests, and hackathons — due to scattered communication across Slack, WhatsApp, or word of mouth.
At the same time, event organizers face difficulties in finding volunteers and estimating student turnout, relying on repeated Google Forms and guesswork to manage everything.

* Helps **students explore, RSVP**, and track events
