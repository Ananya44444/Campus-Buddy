# 🎓 Campus Buddy

A centralized web-based platform to help students **discover, RSVP, and track campus events** — built for students and clubs to stay connected, updated, and engaged.

---

## 📌 Problem

Students often miss out on college events, workshops, hackathons, or club activities due to scattered communication and the lack of a centralized, smart event discovery system.

---

## 🚀 Solution

Campus Buddy solves this with a student-first, smart platform where:

- 🎯 Students can view, filter, and RSVP to **upcoming and past events**
- 🏛️ Clubs can post and manage **events and volunteer requests**
- 🔍 Events can be filtered by **tag, type, department, or club**
- 🔔 Email reminders (for RSVP’d events) help reduce no-shows
- 📆 (Future) Google Calendar integration and gamified engagement
