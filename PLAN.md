# 🧠 Project Plan – Campus Buddy

## 📌 Problem Statement

Students often miss out on campus events, workshops, hackathons, or club activities because there's no centralized, smart, or filtered platform to track what's happening in college.

## 🎯 Solution

Campus Buddy is a centralized, web-based platform where:
- Students can view and RSVP to upcoming events
- Clubs can post/manage events and updates
- Event discovery is smart and filtered using interest tags

## 🛠️ Key Features (Planned)

### 🎉 Student Features
- View upcoming and past events
- Filter by tag, department, club, or type
- RSVP to events (stored in MongoDB)
- Login using student email

### 🏛️ Club Features
- Login using club email
- Create/edit/delete events
- Request volunteers

### 🗓️ Extras (Optional Future Plans)
- Add to Google Calendar
- Email reminders for RSVP'd events
- Gamification (planned for future)
